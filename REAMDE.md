# Overview

I created this project as part of my efforts to further familiarize myself with the Rust programming language. I wanted to make a address book because it would let me explore how to work with diffent elemets of the language.

This is a simple address book program. It is run on the command line. When you first start the program you are presented with a menu. Through this menu you can select from 6 different options. You can add new contacts, edit previous contacts, search for a contact, view all contacts, delete a contact, or exit the program. This program uses a seperate contacts.json file to store the contact info.

I wrote this software because I knew that it would help me learn how to use json files with Rust, as well as help me learn to use user input in meaningful ways.
